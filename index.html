    <p> Hello! My name is Bobby Atilano!</p>
    <p>
      I am an upcoming college student who is seeking a job in the gaming industry in the future. I have been in Pasadena High School's coding academy since freshman year and I've worked with many different coding languages such as Python, Javascript, CSS, HTML, and Godot. 
      Although I am starting from Pasadena City College, I plan to transfer to Cal Poly Pomona for my last two years with Computer Science as my major. 
      Video Games have been my lifetime passion and I cannot wait to see where my future takes me.

          A group project done with three other people. Our project was a platformer game with speedrun type elements. 
          The goal of the game is to reach the hidden house with the fastest time and highest score. 
          My work on the game was the map itself as well as the tricks sprinkled throughout the level.

            This game was made junior year for my AP Computer Science Principles test. The game is a turn based battle made in Python. 
            Working on a project like this taught me how important peer collaboration is.
